# Hello world.
I am Darren John de Lima. 

Currently a student electromechanical engineer who enjoys creating art and products for home use, I also run a homeserver and function as my family's sysadmin/tech support.

If you'd like to see programming-related projects I've worked on [see my pinned repositories](Pinned.md); I've included notes. Due to my workflow, GitHub forks and GitHub's default pinned repositories are not the best way to view these.

My to-do list is [here](TODO.md).

Live long and prosper ðŸ––

## Focus
- audio recordings for my little niece @ [HeartThis.at](https://hearthis.at/darren-de-lima/)
- get personal blog set up @ [djdl.ml](https://djdl.ml)
- university lecture recordings archive

## Showcase
Raspberry Pi homeserver succesfully running!

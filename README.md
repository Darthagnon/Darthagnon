Darthagnon's pinned repositories on GitHub

GitHub only allows you to pin 6 repositories. I work on a lot more than that.

## My projects
Wherein I did program, design and put in some original thought

### double-click
- [https://github.com/Darthagnon/double-click](https://github.com/Darthagnon/double-click)
- AHK (AutoHotkey)
- Double click on blank space in Windows Explorer to go up a folder level; double click on blank space on the Windows Desktop to hide/restore all your icons.

### keepass better dark theme
- [https://github.com/Darthagnon/keepass-better-dark-theme](https://github.com/Darthagnon/keepass-better-dark-theme)
- INI
- Better default dark theme for [KeeTheme](https://github.com/xatupal/KeeTheme/) KeePass plugin (default theme has illegible text)

### FXWebPlayer w2i Installer
- [https://github.com/Darthagnon/FXWebPlayer-w2i-Installer](https://github.com/Darthagnon/FXWebPlayer-w2i-Installer)
- Batch file
- DRM-free installer script for games downloaded from the (legacy and insecure) Spanish [FX Web Store](https://juegos.fxinteractive.com/)

### Utils toolbar
- [https://github.com/Darthagnon/utils-toolbar](https://github.com/Darthagnon/utils-toolbar)
- \*.lnk Windows shortcuts
- Shortcuts to a collection of must-have settings for Windows, made because I got tired of searching through Win7 Control Panel for settings (and this only got harder with Win10). Intended usage: as a Windows Taskbar toolbar, from which you can access every setting you'll ever need.

### CtrlFrything
- [https://github.com/Darthagnon/ctrlfrything](https://github.com/Darthagnon/ctrlfrything)
- AHK (AutoHotkey)
- Hotkeys for [Voidtools' Everything](https://voidtools.com/), allowing you to ```Search current folder``` in Everything via Ctrl+F and ```Global search``` via Win+S, effectively allowing you to disable Windows Search Indexer.

### GBM Manual
- [https://github.com/Darthagnon/gbm-manual](https://github.com/Darthagnon/gbm-manual)
- CHM (Windows Help File)
- Offline manual for the excellent gamesave backup tool [Game Backup Monitor](https://github.com/MikeMaximus/gbm)

### robot-one.github.io / robot-one.tk / robotone.tk
- [https://github.com/robot-one/robot-one.github.io](https://github.com/robot-one/robot-one.github.io)
- Markdown, HTML/CSS, JS
- My work-in-progress blog and news site, built with [GoHugo](https://gohugo.io/)

### djdl.ml
- [https://github.com/Darthagnon/djdl.ml](https://github.com/Darthagnon/djdl.ml) (public site repo)
- [https://github.com/Darthagnon/djdl.ml-src](https://github.com/Darthagnon/djdl.ml-src) (private site source repo)
- Markdown, HTML/CSS, JS
- My CV website, used to point people to my other projects and a placeholder for my blog

### taskbar-groups
- [https://github.com/tjackenpacken/taskbar-groups/issues/19](https://github.com/tjackenpacken/taskbar-groups/issues/19)
- graphic design
- Taskbar Groups is an innovative popup folder program. It lacked a suitable icon on release, so I started making one for it.


## Other people's projects I've worked on
Or, where I didn't do much but build the source code or contribute some ideas or someone else's files.

### SymWin
- [https://github.com/Darthagnon/SymWinBinaries](https://github.com/Darthagnon/SymWinBinaries)
- C# (build and minor edits)
- The best tool for typing accented letters on Windows. Originally made by [Marcus van Houdt](https://github.com/mjvh80/SymWin), he didn't leave us any binaries, only source code. So I built the project fixed some missing keys.

### Pomotimer
- [https://github.com/Darthagnon/pomotimer](https://github.com/Darthagnon/pomotimer)
- F# (build only)
- A nice-looking Pomodoro timer by [Marcus van Houdt](https://github.com/mjvh80/pomotimer). He hasn't been on GitHub since 2018, and didn't leave behind any binaries (EXEs) of the project, so I built it from source and tagged a release.

### npp-task-list
- [https://github.com/Darthagnon/npp-task-list/releases/](https://github.com/Darthagnon/npp-task-list/releases/)
- C/C++ (build, minor edits)
- A very useful plugin for Notepad++ that lets you bookmark places in your code/documents and jump between them. I tracked down the most up-to-date fork, figured out how to get it working on modern Notepad++ (the location of config files has changed, which must be accounted for, alongside legacy plugins) and built binaries to use. 

### PEGI icons, etc.
- [https://github.com/Darthagnon/PEGI](https://github.com/Darthagnon/PEGI)
- SVG/PNG images
- A collection of PNGs and SVGs of videogame censor age-rating icons, which I eventually hope to use with the [Playnite launcher](https://playnite.link/)

### Segoemoji
- [https://github.com/Darthagnon/Segoemoji](https://github.com/Darthagnon/Segoemoji)
- TTF fonts for Windows
- Windows 7 needs the Segoe Emoji and Symbols fonts to be able to use Emoji. I couldn't find them anywhere online, so I extracted them from a recent Win10 installation. Can also be used to update older Win10 font installations.

### The Last Good Web Browsers
- [https://github.com/Darthagnon/The-Last-Good-Web-Browsers](https://github.com/Darthagnon/The-Last-Good-Web-Browsers)
- Markdown
- A list of final good versions of various web browsers that I made, because I don't like the direction that Chrome, Opera, Firefox, et al. are going.

### WinMoji
- [https://github.com/Darthagnon/winmoji](https://github.com/Darthagnon/winmoji)
- Electron
- Best emoji keyboard for Windows. [Original version](https://github.com/ryanSN/winmoji) added telemetry in v2.3.0; I "opted out" by forking, removing telemetry and updater and built a 32bit release (Electron uses a lot of RAM, 32bit uses a little less)

### Game Backup Monitor
- [https://github.com/MikeMaximus/gbm/discussions/209](https://github.com/MikeMaximus/gbm/discussions/209)
- Suggestions RE: layout, graphics
- I entered into some detailed correspondence with MikeMaximus, the maker of Game Backup Monitor, and offered a bunch of suggestions, prototypes, and some icons to help improve the software from being a gamesave monitor to a fully-fledged launcher.



## Archived projects

### betternotesvivaldi
- [https://github.com/Darthagnon/Darthagnons-Vivaldi-Mods](https://github.com/Darthagnon/Darthagnons-Vivaldi-Mods)
- HTML/CSS
- A minor edit I made of LonMacGregor's Better Notes mod for the [Vivaldi web browser](https://vivaldi.com/), before they implemented a proper fullscreen native notes editor

### corsair.tk
- [https://github.com/Darthagnon/corsair.tk](https://github.com/Darthagnon/corsair.tk)
- Markdown
- List of DRM-free resources I made to share with friends and family. I originally managed to register the domain ```corsair.tk``` via [FreeNom](https://www.freenom.com/), but lost it and was unable to renew it (either [Corsair](https://www.corsair.com] claimed it or it was removed due to the questionable subject matter of the list.

### robotone.blogspot.co.uk / robotone.blogspot.com
- [https://robot-one.blogspot.co.uk/](https://robot-one.blogspot.co.uk)
- Blogger platform
- Old blog I tried making a few years ago. The Google Blogger platform is very limited, somewhat legacy, and tied to Google. I wanted something better and independent, where I have full source-code access and can rehost anywhere.
